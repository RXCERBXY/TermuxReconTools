Please expect some imperfections and/or errors as this is my first time making something like this with such functionality.

I hold no responsibility if you decide to do something unethical with the information you gather from using this batch file. Be careful with what you do if you do anything with the information. It's illegal if you don't get consent from the person before you use such information for penetration testing and such. It's also only illegal if you get caught :)

Requirements:

1: nmap
```
https://nmap.org/download.html
```

2: WHOIS

(Install Chocolatey using windows powershell running as administrator as this was the easiest way for me to install WHOIS)

Choco install command
```
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```
Install command for WHOIS using Choco
```
choco install whois -y
```
Verify that WHOIS has successfully installed
```
whois --version
```

I got inspiration to do this from using other Recon Tools like REDHAWK and ReconDog. Go check them out and support their projects
